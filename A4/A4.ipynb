    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we were first tasked with answeriing and discussing differences between classification models, such as, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). The later practical part of this assignment involves implementing using the 'Smarket.csv' dataset which is a financial dataset that containst stock market returns. The classification models will be used to predict market movements. Conclusions and interpretations of the outputs will also be made in this notebook to make it clearer as to how and why certain calculations are computed and what their results indicate.\n",
